### Readme: replication package for "The Winners and Losers of Climate Policies"

This package consists of the code files and folder structure to replicate the analysis of *The Winners and Losers of Climate Policies: A Sufficient Statistics Approach* by Thomas Bourany and Jordan Rosenthal-Kay.

We include some data sources for convenience, while other larger data files are omitted, though are readily available for download, and are documented in the README files in each subfolder. 

To replicate the paper, follow the instructions in the code folder's README.
